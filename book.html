<li id="chap1">Chapter 1: A human
<li> A human is a complex oragnism. A product of million of years of evoluton(if you hear scientists) or creation (if you here creationists).
  The only organism capable of creating concepts. The only organism which can actually take control of his/her sorroundings. 
  The master. Apex predator. Human can imagine the creation of earth, solar system and universe.
  But is he always right? No, human often make mistakes too. But he/she also can rectify the mistakes. All in all, he/she can do what no
  other oragnism can. 
 We are discussing human's fate in this book. An individuals fate. Well, a human dies. We have nobody living among us who was born in 1800 or before that. Whatever divine powers they claim, not with standing.
  But what after that?
<li id="chap2">Chapter 2: What we hear
  <img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife#/media/File:Domenico_Beccafumi_056.jpg" alt="hell" width="100%" height="40%">
Well, we are told a lot of things. We are told a human dies and should be buried. when day of armageddon comes. God will judge him/her and 
  sent him/her to hell or heaven depending upon his/her deeds.
  But some others say, human is directly sent to ultimate judge after death and dispatched to heaven or hell. In hell he is burnt or roasted
  and tortured while in heaven he/she lives in luxury and abundance and beauty.
  Indic religions beleive humans after death die but their soul lives on, which enters another  body. So they keep living as humans but also they only have seven 
  lives after which they either are gone forever or become some animal.
  Other Indians say a human is born and dies then he/she lives several lives as different species and as they say there are 8.4 million species
  The soul lives these 8.4 milliom lives before he/she gets a chance to become human again.
  Some say there is a land of dead  or underworld where they keep living on. Kind of second life.
  But some others reject after life altogether.
  Theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking rejected the concept of an afterlife, saying, "I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark."
  
  
<li id="chap3">Chapter 3: What we see
  In 2008, a large-scale study conducted by the University of Southampton involving 2060 patients from 15 hospitals in the United 
  Kingdom, United States and Austria was launched. The AWARE (AWAreness during REsuscitation) study examined the broad range of mental 
  experiences in relation to death. In a large study, researchers also tested the validity of conscious experiences for the first time
  using objective markers, to determine whether claims of awareness compatible with out-of-body experiences correspond with real or 
  hallucinatory events. The results revealed 
  that in some cases of cardiac arrest, memories of visual awareness compatible with so called out-of-body experiences may correspond 
  with actual events.
  That 40% of those who survived a cardiac arrest were aware during the time that they were clinically dead and before their hearts
  were restarted. One patient also had a verified out-of-body experience , but his cardiac arrest occurred in a room without markers. 
  Dr. Parnia in the interview stated, "The evidence thus far suggests that in the first few minutes after death, consciousness is not 
  annihilated." 
  One case was validated and timed using auditory stimuli during cardiac arrest. Dr Parnia concluded: “This is significant, since it has
  often been assumed that experiences in relation to death are likely hallucinations or illusions, occurring either before the heart 
  stops or after the heart has been successfully restarted, but not an experience corresponding with ‘real’ events when the heart isn’t
  beating. In this case, consciousness and awareness appeared to occur during a three-minute period when there was no heartbeat. This 
  is paradoxical, since the brain typically ceases functioning within 20-30 seconds of the heart stopping and doesn’t resume again 
  until the heart has been restarted. Furthermore, the detailed recollections of visual awareness in this case were consistent with 
  verified events.
  The study continues in AWARE II, which is set to be completed in September 2020.
