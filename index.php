<li><a href="chdtrust.epizy.com">The farmer of Punjab was helpless in the face of relentless onslaught of the Abdali and his forces of Pathans. Abdali had defeated Sikhs, Rajput, Mughals and Marathas .  The farmer still had to eat and entire villages were dependant on their farmers produce. But Abdali looted everything he could get his hands on. He looted everything he laid his eyes on. So the farmer did what nobody thought off. Farmer dug holes in ground and hid in them large clay pots filled with grains. Only he knew thier location. Abdali came and went  with his loot. Then the farmer pulled out his produce which he had hid in his mother earth and he could eat again, entire village dependent on him, could eat again and Punjab kept flourishing. </a></li>
 <li><a href="chdtrust.epizy.com">Story: Rapes of the Muslim girls. The day was rainy and mood was heavy. India and Pakistan were created but Punjab was not celebrating. Punjab was seeing bloodshed and rivers of dead bodies. This was not a sawan, as rainy season is called in Punjab, of joy and fulfillment but of destruction and fear. Here in the heart of Amritsar was the renowned Muslim girls school where girls of Muslim well to do families studied and lived. The riot was a blood feast for wolves. And Billa and Kala were wolves of all season. They had on daily basis leered at the girls as innocent as butter and tried to put their dirty hands on them. But in the chaos of 1947, their time had come. British, Hindu and Muslim intellectuals and leaders had stirred the perfect boiling pot which bring forth the worst in the humans. But wolves were always ready for the dark. They rallied a crowd and attacked the Muslim girls school. The good staff of the school boarded the doors. But they were smashed down. The girls prescient of their fate huddled in the corners, some tried to run away but the tall walls of school which were protecting them, stopped them. They were crying and hugging each other. Billa and Kala directly ran into their living quarters and dragged them and started molesting them. They slapped them, groped them and made them swirm in pain. More men came in. They beat the girls and asked them to go to school grounds. No body stopped Billa and Kala from what they were doing in the corner with two girls. They had their hands on. " This is revenge. What these mullahs did with our sisters in Lahore , its right before your eyes. And we will make them pay. We won't let one Muslim girl to leave the school with her honour intact. Revenge. Real men can stay. Others can leave."  A middle aged men from crowd yelled at the crowd. Then he proceeded and tore a girls kurta barring her before the eyes of onlookers, pulled her salwar down and laid on top of her right there. Few other boys came forward and did like wise with girls. By the end of the day, they had avenged from each girl the price of India and Pakistan. What happened to them is a mystery, washed in the sawan of 1947. </a></li>
