<h4>An Introduction</h4>
<h5>Editor</h5>
<p>Welcome to chdtrust journal. Science publication is a lucrative business for science publishers. 
The authors pay a fees to get their article published. The reviewers review it for free and then libraries and public pays for journals to read it. 
We don't like this system. We intend to pay the author of article and provide the public with free online access to contents. We think reviewer should be just a volunteer.
<br>
How much we will pay? 
<br>
We will divide a prize sum equally among all the authors. We will declare the prize sum in each issue and then that will be divided among the authors of all articles.</p>
