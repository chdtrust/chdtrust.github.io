<h5>Christian way of life</h5>
<h6>Christians beleive in a heaven</h6> <h6>What is heaven?</h6><h6> To maintain neutrality we have provided here what has been written on
  wikipedia and thus universally acceptable. From wikipedia: In Christianity, heaven is traditionally the location of the throne of God as well as the holy angels. In traditional Christianity, it is considered to be a physical place in the afterlife. (Afterlife. What is afterlife . Let us know in the comments. Has anyone ever came back from that stage and told us about it. Is there such a thing or is it somebodies mental creation? Do you beleive in the afterlife?) In most forms of Christianity, Heaven is also understood as the abode for the righteous dead in the afterlife, usually a temporary stage before the resurrection of the dead and the saints' return to the New Earth.

In the Book of Acts, the resurrected Jesus ascends to heaven where, as the Nicene Creed states, he now sits at the right hand of God and will return to Earth in the Second Coming. Various people have been said to have entered heaven while still alive, including Enoch, Elijah and Jesus himself, after his resurrection. According to Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox teaching, Mary, the mother of Jesus, is also said to have been assumed into heaven and is titled the Queen of Heaven.

In the Christian Bible, concepts about the future "Kingdom of Heaven" are professed in several scriptural prophecies of the new (or renewed) Earth said to follow the resurrection of the dead—particularly the books of Isaiah and Revelation and other sources of Christian eschatology. 
  Now, we would like to add here that christian heaven is derived from jewsih concept of heaven</h6>

<h5>Jewish concept of heaven</h5>
<h6> From wikipedia: As in other ancient Near Eastern cultures, in the Hebrew Bible, the universe is commonly divided into two realms: heaven (šāmayim) and earth (’ereṣ). Sometimes a third realm is added: either "sea" (Exodus 20:11, Genesis 1:10), "water under the earth" (Exodus 20:4, Deuteronomy 5:8), or sometimes a vague "land of the dead" that is never described in depth (Job 26:5, Psalm 139:8, Amos 9:2). The structure of heaven itself is never fully described in the Hebrew Bible, but the fact that the Hebrew word šāmayim is plural has been interpreted by scholars as an indication that the ancient Israelites envisioned the heavens as having multiple layers, much like the ancient Mesopotamians. This reading is also supported by the use of the phrase "heaven of heavens" in verses such as Deteronomy 10:14, 1 Kings 8:27, and 2 Chronicles 2:6 and 6:18.

In line with the typical view of most Near Eastern cultures, the Hebrew Bible depicts heaven as a place that is inaccessible to humans. Although some prophets are occasionally granted temporary visionary access to heaven, such as in 1 Kings 22:19–23, Job 1:6–12 and 2:1–6, and Isaiah 6, they hear only God's deliberations concerning the earth and learn nothing of what heaven is like. There is almost no mention in the Hebrew Bible of heaven as a possible afterlife destination for human beings, who are instead described as "resting" in Sheol (Genesis 25:7–9, Deuteronomy 34:6, 1 Kings 2:10). The only two possible exceptions to this are Enoch, who is described in Genesis 5:24 as having been "taken" by God, and the prophet Elijah, who is described in 2 Kings 2:11 as having ascended to heaven in a chariot of fire. According to Michael B. Hundley, the text in both of these instances is ambiguous regarding the significance of the actions being described and in neither of these cases does the text explain what happened to the subject afterwards.[27]

The God of the Israelites is described as ruling both heaven and earth (Genesis 14:19 22 24:3, Psalm 146:6). Other passages, such as 1 Kings 8:27 state that even the vastness of heaven cannot contain God's majesty. A number of passages throughout the Hebrew Bible indicate that heaven and earth will one day come to an end (Psalm 102:26–27, Isaiah 13:5, 14:26, 24:18, 51:6, Jeremiah 4:23–28, and Zephaniah 1:2–3 and 18). This view is paralleled in other ancient Near Eastern cultures, which also regarded heaven and earth as vulnerable and subject to dissolution. However, the Hebrew Bible differs from other ancient Near Eastern cultures in that it portrays the God of Israel as independent of creation and unthreatened by its potential destruction. Because most of the Hebrew Bible concerns the God of Israel's relationship with his people, most of the events described in it take place on earth, not in heaven. The Deuteronomistic source, Deuteronomistic History, and Priestly source all portray the Temple in Jerusalem as the sole channel of communication between earth and heaven. </h6>

    <li>Genetic testing<ul><li>Genetic testing information <li>Q: What is gentic testing? <li>Ans: It is a medical test which identifies diffrence in genes or proteins and tells whether there is a chance of person developing a disease.<li>Q: What is genetic counselour?<li> Ans: Genetic counselour tells whether a person should undertake genetic test or not. He also tells about social, legal and emotional aspects of genetic counselling. <li>Q: What is newborn screening?<li> Ans: When child is born it is tested for gentic diseases which if left untreated could have serious implications. Important newborn tests are phenylketonuria and congenital hypothoroidism. They must be detected and treated immediately. <li>Q: How to Perform a phenylketonuria newborn gentic test? <li> Ans: A PKU test is done a day or two after baby's birth. The test is done after baby is 24 hours old and after  baby has ingested some protein in the diet to ensure accurate results.

    A nurse or lab technician collects a few drops of blood from  baby's heel or the bend in baby's arm.
    A laboratory tests the blood sample for certain metabolic disorders, including PKU.
    
If this test indicates newborn may have PKU:

    Newborn may have additional tests to confirm the diagnosis, including more blood tests and urine tests
    Parent and newborn may have genetic testing to identify gene mutations
