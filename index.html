<h6>You can go wherever you want but certain things are certain in your life. One such thing is death. Yes death. You may have any kind of beleifs. You may be an atheist or you may be religious. Doesn't matter.

What is sure about your fate is you are going to die. All founders of religion have died . Certain founders of sect claimed they wouldn't die but they died.

Well, why keep yourself occupied with random things when you can solve the problem that you will face certainly one day.

What you can do about it?

Well you can find a solution where the problem lies.

Problem lies in you . More specifically your body. It is ageing and dying. Protect it and nurture it.

But it will still wither away.

So what you can do.

Well the problem is you don't understand it fully nor does anyone else.

So lets understand it and see if we can change the way it works.</h6>
