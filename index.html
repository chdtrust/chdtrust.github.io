<h1>Build a lab to stop ageing.</h1>

<h5>You can go wherever you want but certain things are certain in your life. One such thing is death. Yes death. You may have any kind of beliefs. You may be an atheist or you may be religious. Doesn't matter.

What is sure about your fate is you are going to die. All founders of religion have died . Certain founders of sect claimed they wouldn't die but they died.

Well, why keep yourself occupied with random things when you can solve the problem that you will face certainly one day.

What you can do about it?

Well you can find a solution where the problem lies.

Problem lies in you . More specifically your body. It is ageing and dying. Protect it and nurture it.

But it will still wither away.

So what you can do.

Well the problem is you don't understand it fully nor does anyone else.

So lets understand it and see if we can change the way it works.</h5>

 <h5>Christian way of life</h5>
<h6>Christians beleive in a heaven</h6> <h6>What is heaven?</h6><h6> To maintain neutrality we have provided here what has been written on
  wikipedia and thus universally acceptable. From wikipedia: In Christianity, heaven is traditionally the location of the throne of God as well as the holy angels. In traditional Christianity, it is considered to be a physical place in the afterlife. (Afterlife. What is afterlife . Let us know in the comments. Has anyone ever came back from that stage and told us about it. Is there such a thing or is it somebodies mental creation? Do you beleive in the afterlife?) In most forms of Christianity, Heaven is also understood as the abode for the righteous dead in the afterlife, usually a temporary stage before the resurrection of the dead and the saints' return to the New Earth.

In the Book of Acts, the resurrected Jesus ascends to heaven where, as the Nicene Creed states, he now sits at the right hand of God and will return to Earth in the Second Coming. Various people have been said to have entered heaven while still alive, including Enoch, Elijah and Jesus himself, after his resurrection. According to Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox teaching, Mary, the mother of Jesus, is also said to have been assumed into heaven and is titled the Queen of Heaven.

In the Christian Bible, concepts about the future "Kingdom of Heaven" are professed in several scriptural prophecies of the new (or renewed) Earth said to follow the resurrection of the dead—particularly the books of Isaiah and Revelation and other sources of Christian eschatology. 
  Now, we would like to add here that christian heaven is derived from jewsih concept of heaven</h6>

<h5>Jewsih concept of heaven</h5>
<h6> From wikipedia: As in other ancient Near Eastern cultures, in the Hebrew Bible, the universe is commonly divided into two realms: heaven (šāmayim) and earth (’ereṣ). Sometimes a third realm is added: either "sea" (Exodus 20:11, Genesis 1:10), "water under the earth" (Exodus 20:4, Deuteronomy 5:8), or sometimes a vague "land of the dead" that is never described in depth (Job 26:5, Psalm 139:8, Amos 9:2). The structure of heaven itself is never fully described in the Hebrew Bible, but the fact that the Hebrew word šāmayim is plural has been interpreted by scholars as an indication that the ancient Israelites envisioned the heavens as having multiple layers, much like the ancient Mesopotamians. This reading is also supported by the use of the phrase "heaven of heavens" in verses such as Deteronomy 10:14, 1 Kings 8:27, and 2 Chronicles 2:6 and 6:18.

In line with the typical view of most Near Eastern cultures, the Hebrew Bible depicts heaven as a place that is inaccessible to humans. Although some prophets are occasionally granted temporary visionary access to heaven, such as in 1 Kings 22:19–23, Job 1:6–12 and 2:1–6, and Isaiah 6, they hear only God's deliberations concerning the earth and learn nothing of what heaven is like. There is almost no mention in the Hebrew Bible of heaven as a possible afterlife destination for human beings, who are instead described as "resting" in Sheol (Genesis 25:7–9, Deuteronomy 34:6, 1 Kings 2:10). The only two possible exceptions to this are Enoch, who is described in Genesis 5:24 as having been "taken" by God, and the prophet Elijah, who is described in 2 Kings 2:11 as having ascended to heaven in a chariot of fire. According to Michael B. Hundley, the text in both of these instances is ambiguous regarding the significance of the actions being described and in neither of these cases does the text explain what happened to the subject afterwards.[27]

The God of the Israelites is described as ruling both heaven and earth (Genesis 14:19 22 24:3, Psalm 146:6). Other passages, such as 1 Kings 8:27 state that even the vastness of heaven cannot contain God's majesty. A number of passages throughout the Hebrew Bible indicate that heaven and earth will one day come to an end (Psalm 102:26–27, Isaiah 13:5, 14:26, 24:18, 51:6, Jeremiah 4:23–28, and Zephaniah 1:2–3 and 18). This view is paralleled in other ancient Near Eastern cultures, which also regarded heaven and earth as vulnerable and subject to dissolution. However, the Hebrew Bible differs from other ancient Near Eastern cultures in that it portrays the God of Israel as independent of creation and unthreatened by its potential destruction. Because most of the Hebrew Bible concerns the God of Israel's relationship with his people, most of the events described in it take place on earth, not in heaven. The Deuteronomistic source, Deuteronomistic History, and Priestly source all portray the Temple in Jerusalem as the sole channel of communication between earth and heaven. </h6>

<h5 align="center">Not possible</h5>
  Well Lets talk then. There are 300 theories of ageing. But we are working on one that says that our genes are responsible for ageing.
  There is a database called agemap which is a gene expression database of ageing mouse. We are going to upregulate the downregulating genes of mouse and we are hoping that will stop ageing in mouse.
  Its doable.
