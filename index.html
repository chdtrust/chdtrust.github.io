<h6>You can go wherever you want but certain things are certain in your life. One such thing is death. Yes death. You may have any kind of beliefs. You may be an atheist or you may be religious. Doesn't matter.

What is sure about your fate is you are going to die. All founders of religion have died . Certain founders of sect claimed they wouldn't die but they died.

Well, why keep yourself occupied with random things when you can solve the problem that you will face certainly one day.

What you can do about it?

Well you can find a solution where the problem lies.

Problem lies in you . More specifically your body. It is ageing and dying. Protect it and nurture it.

But it will still wither away.

So what you can do.

Well the problem is you don't understand it fully nor does anyone else.

So lets understand it and see if we can change the way it works.</h6>

  Well Lets talk then. There are 300 theories of ageing. But we are working on one that says that our genes are responsible for ageing.
  There is a databse called agemap which is a gene expression database of ageing mouse. We are going to upregulate the downregulating genes of mouse and we are hoping that will stop ageing in mouse.
  Its doable.
